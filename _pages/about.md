I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst at UC Davis. For the past 2+ years, I've worked with student and employee data to look for insights and help departments with their business needs. Outside of work, I've expanded into data science by doing projects showcased on this site.

Competencies: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), R, SQL, Tableau (server administration, visualization), ETL workflows, Drupal.
